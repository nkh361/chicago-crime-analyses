<h1>Why?</h1>
<p>
  The City of Chicago releases crime data to the public. This application would allow users to see the type of crime around a given location and allow users to be more informed with their surroundings. Chicago is a sketchy place if you are not aware of your surroundings and this app could help with your commute.
</p>

<h1>How?</h1>
<p>
  The user will input a given location (for now it is via latitude and longitude, will be more automated as time comes) and will trigger a SQL query to collect all entries within a given radius. After this query triggers, there will be a ranking system that determines the most popular type of crime in the area and a time range of when these crimes occur according to the data.
